# MyLib - Personel Library System!

Hi ðŸ‘‹,
MyLib is a personal book assistant application. In this project primarily uses HTML, CSS, and PHP. Laravel's helpful features have been utilized.

## Version 1.0 Features


- **User Authentication**: Utilizes Laravel Auth for secure login and registration processes.
- **Logged-in or Guest Header**: Different header displays for guests who are not logged in and for users who are logged in.
- **Admin Panel**: A simple panel for administrators that allows them to delete users, modify their permissions, and view their information.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Used to write the application's backend. Features such as **Controller, Migration, Middleware, Models,** and **Route** were heavily utilized. The **Laravel** framework simplified all these processes significantly.
-- *AuthController* for authorization control
-- *AdminController* for page protection and CRUD operations
-- *AdminMiddleware* for Redirect to login page if user is not admin
-- *Route Protection* working with *AdminController*

- **HTML - CSS**: It was used for the basic design of the application. Later, Tailwind CSS can be added
